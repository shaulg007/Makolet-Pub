You can use the Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE) to create, run, and debug commands and scripts.

The Windows PowerShell ISE consists of the menu bar, Windows PowerShell tabs, the toolbar, script tabs, a Script Pane, a Console Pane, a status bar, a text-size slider and context-sensitive Help.

## **Menu Bar**

The menu bar contains the **File**, **Edit**, **View**, **Tools**, **Debug**, **Add-ons**, and **Help** menus.

The buttons on the menus allow you to perform tasks related to writing and running scripts and running commands in the Windows PowerShell ISE. Additionally, an [add-on tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/windows-powershell/ise/object-model/the-iseaddontool-object?view=powershell-5.1) may be placed on the menu bar by running scripts that use the [The ISE Object Model Hierarchy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/windows-powershell/ise/object-model/the-ise-object-model-hierarchy?view=powershell-5.1).

## **Toolbar**

A Windows PowerShell tab is the environment in which a Windows PowerShell script runs. You can open new Windows PowerShell tabs in the Windows PowerShell ISE to create separate environments on your local computer or on remote computers. You may have a maximum of eight PowerShell tabs simultaneously open.

For more information, see [How to Create a PowerShell Tab in Windows PowerShell ISE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/windows-powershell/ise/how-to-create-a-powershell-tab-in-windows-powershell-ise?view=powershell-5.1).

## **Script Tab**

Displays the name of the script you are editing. You can click a script tab to select the script you want to edit.

When you point to the script tab, the fully qualified path to the script file appears in a tooltip.

Allows you to create and run scripts. You can open, edit and run existing scripts in the Script Pane.

## **Help**

Help for Windows PowerShell ISE is available on Microsoft Learn. You can open the Help by clicking **Windows PowerShell ISE Help** on the **Help** menu or by pressing the F1 key anywhere except when the cursor is on a cmdlet name in either the Script Pane or the Console Pane. From the **Help** menu you can also run the `Update-Help` cmdlet, and display the Command Window which assists you in constructing commands by showing you all the parameters for a cmdlet and enabling you to fill in the parameters in an easy-to-use form.
